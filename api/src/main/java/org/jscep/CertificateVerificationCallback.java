 * This class is used to obtain verification of the fingerprint of a CA

 * The SCEP specification states that the CA certificate must be provided
 * out-of-band, and that the CA certificate fingerprint MAY be used to authenticate
 * that certificate.  The specification also states that only particular algorithms
 * may be used to create the fingerprint, so we allow the client to choose the
 * algorithm fingerprint, whilst keeping the CA certificate secret.
 * <p>
 * Use of the term MAY in the above statement means that other forms of authentication
 * should be acceptable, but it should be fairly trivial for clients to figure out the
 * hash.
